    "A database is a structured collection of data that can be stored, accessed, and managed electronically. Databases can be used to store any type of information, from simple lists to complex data such as financial records, customer data, and scientific research data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL databases and NoSQL databases are two types of databases that differ in their data models, storage methods, and query languages:\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL (Structured Query Language) databases:\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL databases are based on the relational data model, which organizes data into tables with rows and columns.\n",
    "SQL databases use SQL as their query language for performing operations such as creating, reading, updating, and deleting data.\n",
    "SQL databases have a predefined schema that defines the structure of the data and the relationships between tables.\n",
    "SQL databases are known for their ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) properties, which ensure that transactions are reliable and consistent.\n",
    "Some examples of SQL databases include MySQL, Oracle, SQL Server, and PostgreSQL.\n",
    "\n",
    "NoSQL (Not Only SQL) databases:\n",
    "\n",
    "NoSQL databases use various data models, such as document, key-value, graph, or column-family, to store and manage data.\n",
    "NoSQL databases use different query languages and APIs for manipulating data, depending on the type of database and its data model.\n",
    "NoSQL databases have a flexible schema that allows for dynamic changes to the data structure without requiring a predefined schema.\n",
    "NoSQL databases are often designed for scalability, high availability, and performance, and may sacrifice some of the ACID properties of SQL databases to achieve these goals.\n",
    "Some examples of NoSQL databases include MongoDB, Cassandra, Redis, and Amazon DynamoDB.\n",
    "\n",

    "DDL (Data Definition Language) is a subset of SQL (Structured Query Language) that is used to define, modify, and delete the structure of a database schema. DDL statements are used to create, alter, and delete database objects such as tables, indexes, and views.\n",
